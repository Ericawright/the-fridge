    Preheat oven to 325.
Steam broccoli for 5 minutes until crisp-tender. Drain in colander.
In a medium frying pan, saute chicken breasts in olive oil until lightly browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from heat and drain on paper towls.
In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to eliminate the taste of raw flour. Then gradually whisk in cream soup. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer until the sauce is the consistency you desire. Add 3/4 of the cheese blend and whisk until combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.
In a 9x13 dish arrange chicken breasts (either whole or sliced) and broccoli. Pour sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover with aluminum foil. Make several slits in the aluminum foil to allow the steam to escape.
Note: At this point, the dish can be frozen or refrigerated.
